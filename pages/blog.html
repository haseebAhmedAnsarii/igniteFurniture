                    If you have ever had to work from home, you’d know how important having a home office can be. Not
                    only does it help with your productivity but also gives you a comfortable space to work. Besides, it
                    adds functionality and ensures that everything is in the right place. When it comes to choosing home
                    office furniture, the desk plays the most critical role. Although buying a customized desk from the
                    market can be super expensive, there are many DIY options out there to help you build the most
                    appropriate desk for your specific needs. Using those DIY options, you can create a corner desk,
                    standing desk, or any other type of desk you prefer. <br> <br>

                    In this article, we will discuss some inspiring DIY office desk ideas for you to consider: <br><br>
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">DIY Standing Desk</h5>
                    These desks can be very expensive when bought from the market. Therefore, building one at home can
                    be the most economical option. Items for building DIY standing desks can be bought from any hardware
                    store. Besides, these desks are easy to build and a lot of information can be found on the internet
                    about how to build them.
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold my-3">Design a new desk from scratch</h5>
                    This is a little complex project but completely doable with some careful planning and construction.
                    Building a new desk with custom design and features may not be the easiest job, but it’s the best
                    way to get exactly what you want. You can use a solid old door for the tabletop while pieces of pine
                    for legs. To create space for cables and cords, keep the center of the legs hollow. Once the
                    structure is ready, give it a fresh paint job to make it usable.
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold my-3">Pipe-leg desk</h5>
                    If you’re a fan of industrial style, your desk doesn’t necessarily have to be made of roughhewn wood
                    to give out the edgy industrial vibe you love.

                    You can achieve the same effect with pipes. Yes, galvanized pipes can be used as legs for a clean
                    desktop to create an attractive home office desk.

                    So, these are some of our DIY desk ideas that you can use to avoid spending money on buying office
                    furniture online. Try them out and let us know if they worked for you.</div>

                    <h4 class="text-center my-3 font-weight-bold">The Fault In Our Chairs</h4>
                    Working for long hours in an uncomfortable workplace can be a chore! The type of environment in
                    which you work, every day, can significantly affect how you perform and feel. People may work in
                    administrative positions that require them to spend a great deal of time behind a computer, without
                    much mobility. This causes them to slouch and develop back pain without much chance to stretch their
                    legs.
                    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), one-third of all employee injury and illness
                    cases are musculoskeletal disorders. However, studies have also found that there is no direct link
                    between sitting and back pain. Then what really is the problem? One problem possibly stems from the
                    fault in our chairs. Although the comfort level of different chairs varies, there are those that
                    simply do not meet the requirements of providing adequate support or comfort in areas most needed.
                    Most office chairs are not made for long marathon sitting which greatly hinders performance, since
                    they are designed for brief meetings or while waiting for colleagues.
                    On the other hand, Interwood’s ergonomic office chairs like the premium quality executive chair, The
                    Snare, helps reduce pressure on an individual’s hips, spine, and back. Investing in an ergonomic
                    office chair can also help mitigate posture problems in those who developed them early on. Other
                    great health benefits of chairs, designed keeping function and comfort in mind, include improving
                    efficiency and eliminating fatigue and posture.
                    Interwood, as an organization, has dedicated its research and innovation towards creating furniture
                    that enhances comfortable living and contributes towards building a healthy work environment. So
                    employers, it’s time to reward your employees with the comfort they deserve by realizing the fault
                    in your chairs and taking necessary measures to fix it.
